Simple TicTacToe
=====
Simple TicTacToe is a simple example for a game AI created as a part of the project realized in BUP, Technische Berufsschule ZÃ¼rich, 5. Semester.
Its goal is to show the structure and usage of an aritificial intelligence to create an opponent you can not win against. (Promised, we'll get cake for it!)
Since Tic Tac Toe is a very simple game, the computer is able to fully calculate every possible route and select the best one.
