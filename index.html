				<strong>Simple TicTacToe</strong><br />
				Simple TicTacToe is a basic example game to show the functionality of the
				Negamax algorithm using one of the simplest games ever created. Tic Tac Toe,
				also known as X&amp;O's is a turn based mini-game where you can set your symbol
				to one of the nine fields each turn trying to get three of them in a horizontal,
				vertical or diagonal row.<br /><br />
				<strong>The Minimax algorithm</strong></br>
				Using the Minimax algorithm, the computer calculates every possible move to a specific
				depth of the game tree and selects the best route. Knowing this also leads to the
				main reason for us to choose Tic Tac Toe as an example since it's game-tree is small
				enough to allow the computer to fully calculate every route and become completely invincible.<br /><br />
				<strong>The Negamax algorithm</strong></br>
				The Negamax algorith is a further development of the simple Minimax algorithm,
				it's using so called <i>Alpha-Beta-Purning</i> to increase its speed. While the Minimax
				algorithm calculates the complete route of a possible branch, the Negamax algorithm
				will drop a branch as soon as it notices that it is even worse than the currently
				chosen branch.
